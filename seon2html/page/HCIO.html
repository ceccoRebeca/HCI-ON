<b>HCIO::User Observable State</b><br/>
Specializes RRO::Observable State<br/><br/>
A situation (an Observable State) perceivable by Users, typically achieved as the result (output) of a Program Copy Execution, communicated or presented by an Output Equipment. E.g., a message shown in the mobile phone screen informing the user that the captured fingerprint was not recognized, smart watch vibrating; sounds emitted by the mobile phone.<br/>
