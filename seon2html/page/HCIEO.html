Note: inspection-based evaluation is a generic ter for methods that include, but are not limited to, heuristic evaluation, cognitive walkthroughs, standards inspection, pluralistic walkthroughs, and consistency inspections

ISO 25066:2019
Inspection-based evaluation: evaluation based on the judgment of one or more evaluator(s) who examine or use a system to identify potential usability problems (including deviations from established criteria).

Note: The evaluators making the inspections typically are usability specialists but can also include end users and members of the design team.

Usability problem: situation during use resulting in poor effectiveness, efficiency or satisfaction

ISO 25066:2019
Usability defect: product attribute(s) that lead(s) to a mismatch between user intentions and/or user actions and the system attributes and behavior

ISO 25060: 2010
Usability objective: stated level of usability expressed in terms of effectiveness, efficiency and satisfaction in a specified context of use which can be verified

Note: usability objectives can be stated as user requirements, in which case the level to be achieved is a usability requirement, or they can be stated as desired "target levels" depending on their use in design and evaluation

ISO 25060: 2010
Usability inspection: evaluation based on the considered judgment of evaluators who examine the usability-related aspects of an interface with respect to specified criteria

Note: usability inspection is the generic term for several methods, including but not limited to heuristic evaluation, cognitive walkthroughs, standards inspection, pluralistic walkthroughs, and consistency inspections.

ISO 25060: 2010
